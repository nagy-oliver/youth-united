        <h4><b>Who is Sedef Kabas?</b></h4>
        <h5>Sedef Kabaş is a Turkish journalist known for exposing government corruption. She often criticized the current political system of Turkey, underlining the authoritarian nature of Erdogan. With a foreign educational background, Kabaş came back to work in Turkey after completing her Master’s degree in television journalism from Boston University in Boston (Massachusetts).  She has many achivements in her career, including becoming the CNN International's Atlanta bureau's first Turkish journalist. Throughout her employment, Kabaş reported about Europe, the Middle East, and even the conflict in the Balkans.</h5>
        
        <h4><b>The arrest </b></h4>
        <h5>On the 23rd of January 2022 Kabaş was detained by the police and taken to Istanbul’s main police station, after which she was transferred to Istanbul’s main court. As can be easily guessed, the court ruled in favour of her formal arrest. The reason for this apprehension was that Kabaş was suspected of insulting the current president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, through one of her comments. The alleged defamation came from a palace-related proverb that has been expressed on Kabaş’ Twitter and also on a television channel that is known for it’s resistance to the current system. </h5>
        <h5>She tweeted:</h5>
        <h5>“When the ox climbs to the palace, he does not become a king, but the palace becomes a barn” (Turkish: ”öküz saraya çıkınca kral olmaz, ama saray ahır olur”).</h5>
        <h5>As a reply, the head of Turkey’s communications department, Fahrettin Altun, voiced his opinion on his own Twitter channel: </h5>
        <h5>“The honour of the presidency’s office is the honour of our country… I condemn the vulgar insults made against our president and his office”. Furthermore, he added that the detained journalist Kabas will “get what she deserves” for her “unlawful” words. </h5>
        
        <h4><b>Journalist Sedef Kabaş subjected to face time in jail for reciting a proverb:</b> </h4>
        <h5>Unfortunately, Kabaş now became herself one of the victims she used to report about. The traditional Turkish proverb that was expressed in an interview on the Tele1 Channel makes her liable of up to four years in jail. Kabaş did not name Erdogan directly, which makes noticeable the absurdity and offensive manner of this situation. 
        </h5>
        <h5> Turkey's President is often criticized for more or less usurping political power in Turkey. In addition to that, opposition members, the Turkish diaspora, and even members of his own party found fault with the fact that Erdogan prosecuted over 200 journalists, out of which 70 of them faced similar charges as Kabaș did. For many Turkish people, there doesn’t seem to be an end to the measures that Erdogan is ready to direct towards all voices of dissent. 
        </h5>
        <h5>In fact, it can be said that restriction of the press has become a central element of Erdogan’s presidential career. Turkish youth is sick and tired of being censored and denied to freely speak their minds. They’re tired of a political elite that is actively attempting to install a dictatorship. In the recent past, this has even lead to protests such as the one on December 23, 2017, when the Turkey Journalists` Union (TJU) rallied against press restriction.</h5>
        <h5>Most of the journalists targeted for government-issued “cancellation”, observers say, work for independent news outlets or publications critical of Erdogan. The overall statistics are even more shocking, as we can clearly see that in 2016 more journalists have been imprisoned than in 2014 (84 custodies compared to 7 custodies). </h5>

        <h5>As free press is being restricted in Turkey, Turkish youth are bravely trying to fight for a country in which they would be able to share their views without being afraid of a repressive response from the Government. The Sedef Kabaș scandal is only the latest in a long series of arrests that have happened both in Turkey and abroad, because of autocratic leaders’ need to cement their power through whatever means necessary.</h5>
