        <h4>What is Social Media?</h4>
        <h5>Social media is defined as a set of apps or websites used for communication, in order to interact with new individuals or people you are already close with, as well as for the purpose of sharing life events and/or passions.</h5>
        <h5>Social media can be used for fun, to text friends, to stay in touch with one's relatives or to send birthday wishes to colleagues. Moreover, it is widely appreciated for its usage in business and in one’s work, the main reason for that being that it makes it easy to introduce a project to a group of participants or viewers in just one click, while also allowing the viewing and analysis of specific statistics without any additional effort.</h5>
        <h5>But is social media as good as it sounds at first, and do all of its benefits outweigh its cost of deteriorating users’ mental health?</h5>
        
        <h4>The Negative Impact</h4>
        <h5>Frequent use of social media can result in severe addiction and burnout. Addiction usually manifests itself as not wanting to stop scrolling through your feed, or mindlessly switching from one app to another with the unfulfilled desire to find something new and get a rush of dopamine, when the initial goal was to simply check notifications. “What is dopamine?”, - you may ask. Dopamine is a naturally occurring hormone and neurotransmitter, and is used by your nervous system to send signals between nerve cells. Why do we need dopamine? Dopamine is a pleasure chemical. Simply put, one of the reasons why people become addicted to social media and their mental health suffers is the perpetually high level of dopamine in their bodies – constant use of social media leads to one’s mind being used to the positive feelings that posts or videos stir within them, and when deprived of them, dopamine levels crash, thus leading to spikes in anxiety. The long-term effects of these symptoms can include, but are not limited to serious mental health issues.</h5>
        <h5>Another consequence of excessive social media usage, that itself leads to mental health issues is FOMO - fear of missing out. People who suffer from FOMO are excessively concerned with being informed on everything that is going on around them, at all times. The fear of missing out creates anxiety and depression, preventing an individual from being in the moment when interacting outside the virtual world. It can also affect relationships with the people closest to oneself. A possible solution to this problem is keeping oneself grounded and aware – no matter how hard you try to keep up with the news at all times, remember that you are still human. Just try to let it go and focus on the real life around you. Staying in touch with people will keep you informed and it will have a better influence on your mental health.</h5>
        <h5>These are just some examples of the negative effects social media can have on our mental health. What about the positives? </h5>
        
        <h4>The positives</h4>
        <h5>When having a bad day and feeling the need to unwind, going on social media can actually cheer one up – only on the condition that they know what to look for. For instance, seeing others on vacation has the potential to restore one's faith in the fact thattheir situation can change, and feeling happiness while witnessing others having fun can be beneficial to one’s contentment. Furthermore, loneliness can be ameliorated with the help of social media as well: when you don’t have anyone to talk to or feel like no one is there for you, you can always rely on influencers, who share their advice while showing constant support for individuals in your position.</h5>
        
        <h4>Conclusions</h4>
        <h5>Social media is what we make it. When it is used wisely, and its user-base knows what to look for and what to avoid, then its negative effects are minimized. One’s mental health will only improve as time passes; whereas if there is not a balance between one’s real and virtual life, the lack of “boundaries” in the online sphere can leave an individual feeling anxious or depressed – in this case, social media can have a massive impact on a person’s long-term mental health, with recovery being no easy feat to accomplish.</h5>
